High-Level OverviewYou’ll build a JAMstack-style CMS/blog using modern JavaScript frameworks: a headless CMSbackend to manage content, and a Next.jsfrontend for fast, SEO-friendly rendering and rich interactivity. The system will let you author and organize blog posts (with code snippets, images, tags, categories), manage pages (About, Services, Contact), capture inbound leads (contact form, newsletter), integrate social auth so employers/businesses can connect, and serve as a showcase portfolio piece.1.
